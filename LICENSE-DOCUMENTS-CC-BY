IN BRIEF:
Attribution means:
•	“indicate if changes were made”. You can do this with wording like:
“based on content from https://mod-8-film.com ”
“some ideas from https://mod-8-film.com “
Or source referencing in academic or Wikipedia style.

•	“appropriate credit”. John aims to make this easy by asking only for reference to:
https://mod-8-film.com for links. 
In text “mod-8-film.com” is OK.
Most of the Mod-8 images already provide this as a label.
